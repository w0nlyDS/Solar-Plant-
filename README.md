This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -

Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?


In Solar_Panel_Analysis and Solar_Panel_Analysis_2 is essentially answering the same questions using different feautures within python. (2) focuses on using simpler analysis and plotly to generate some amazing graphs. The main analysis contains EDA, outlier analysis, a comparison of models and fault detection.
